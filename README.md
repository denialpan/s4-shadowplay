s4-shadowplay is a personal project to serve as a file storage system utilizing Amazon S3 as the storage component. Primarily initially used to store video game clips, commonly known as "shadowplays" based on Nvidia, but has expanded to serve as cheaper alternative to storage solutions like Google Drive and Dropbox (gigabytes/US dollar).

## Getting Started

Create `.env.local` in cloned root directory, with these contents:

```text
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="aws key"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="aws secret access key"
AWS_REGION="aws region"
AWS_S3_BUCKET="aws s3 bucket name"
JWT_SECRET="jwt token"
```

AWS related keys and tokens can be generated and retrieved from the [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) and generating an access key. JWT secret token can be generated by running:

```bash
openssl rand -64 64
```

Install packages and run

```bash
npm i && npm run dev
```

Page and API routes will be running on [localhost:3000](http:localhost:3000) by default.

## Todo:

- full screen drag and drop
- file / directory things
  - folder operations
  - file operations
  - shareable file public link
    - expire time (allow infinite...? default 1 hour maybe)
    - allow embed
  - file tagging
- add config file to user customization
  - system
    - upload chunk size (default: 5mb)
    - number of upload chunks (default: 100)
    - max concurrent files uploaded at same time (default: 7)
  - UI
    - colors
    - theming...?
- notification corner popup
  - upload failed (red)
  - upload success (green)
  - miscellaneous that i have no control over (aws being down etc)
  - lost internet connection (locally)

## Review

This section helps to summarize everything that I have learned from solely this project and will continue to research.

- jwt and jose
  - properties of jwt tokens
  - creating a proper jwt token
  - session token expiration and resetting
- database
  - initializing and connecting database
  - read write to sqlite3 db
  - `user.db` to handle accounts
- nextjs file structure (pages)
  - certain file and folder names are reserved for nextjs
    - `/api` - files under here are automatically api routes
    - `index.js` - default page to load at root of \*directory
    - `middleware.js` - serverside before any page or route is loaded
      - allows easy authentication for page and api routing based on use
  - folder structure dictates how a page or api route will be structured
- file streaming and uploading
  - multiple ways to handle file uploads to S3, most commonly is the method implemented here, where a file travels `frontend -> backend` then `backend -> S3 bucket`
  - multipart chunk uploading
- react usestate
  - array handling
  - adding and removing based on conditions
- miscellaneous - things that i learned and have decided not to implement in return for something else that fits this project's purpose more
  - sse (server side event) - how information is passed from backend to frontend without strictly having to send response
    - originally used for tracking the original file upload progress from backend to frontend
  - concurrent vs parallelization - originally used to upload chunks of a file instead of sequentially, but introduced complexity in displaying upload progress
    - concurrent - one CPU core used to rapidly switch between tasks
    - parallel - usage of multiple cores for tasks
    - both were a risk to CPU performance and upload speed
- common internet codes
  - 200
  - 404
  - 405
  - 500
